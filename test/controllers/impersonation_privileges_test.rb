# Impersonation lets an administrator work as another member so the UI *and the logic* that
# member gets can be exercised. Authorization therefore resolves against the impersonated
# account, not the real one.
#
# That is only safe while the substitution can only ever subtract, which rests on two
# properties this file exists to pin down:
#
#   1. Impersonation is in effect only while the real account is still an administrator,
#      re-checked every request — see ApplicationController#impersonating?. An account
#      demoted mid-session stops impersonating rather than keeping the target's authority.
#   2. The way back out never depends on the impersonated member, so an administrator
#      viewing as someone with no privileges at all is never stranded.
#
# Who may act is the impersonated account; who is *recorded* as having acted is the real
# one. Both halves are asserted here.
